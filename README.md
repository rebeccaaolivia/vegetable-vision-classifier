# Vegetable Image Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of 15 different types of vegetables. The model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between various vegetables, making it potentially useful for applications in agriculture, food recognition, or inventory management systems.

## Dataset
The project uses the [Vegetable Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset?select=Vegetable+Images) from Kaggle, which contains:
- 15 vegetable classes
- Pre-split train, validation, and test sets
- Images of various vegetables at different angles and lighting conditions

## Training
The model was trained with:
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Callbacks:
  - EarlyStopping (patience=5)
  - ReduceLROnPlateau (patience=3, factor=0.5)
- Epochs: 30 (early stopping triggered)

## Performance
- Training Accuracy: 97.99%
- Validation Accuracy: 98.33%
- Test Accuracy: 96.97%
- Test Loss: 0.1913

## Future Improvements
1. Implement data augmentation to improve generalization
2. Experiment with transfer learning using pre-trained models
3. Add more vegetable classes
4. Develop a web/mobile interface for easy classification
